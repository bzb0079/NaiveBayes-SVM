The goal of this project is to analyze public opinions and consumer perception towards new mode of transportation in public roads. As such this study goal is to inspire policy makers, autonomous Robo-cars, mobility and fleet shuttles manufactures responding to public needs in terms of safety features and deployment regions. Twitter platform proves to be superior to other social network platforms such as Facebooks in terms of volume of good quality opinion data and ease of data collection and crawling.
